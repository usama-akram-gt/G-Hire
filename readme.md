## G - Hire
Web application where product-owner and developers can work together remotely. The product-owner can register and post their work online and our expert system will recommend them accordingly. Our algorithm will search for the best developers that best suits for their task. The engineerâ€™s portfolio e-g rankings and specialization skills will be updated based on amount of work completed. The developers will then have to pass the selection test in order to get selected for the job. Companies can track work progress using our screen sharing and time tracking feature. The developers can work remotely anytime from anywhere. The payment will be decided based on the work load. The system will manage files on the directory in the form of branches where code could be merge, upload and delete anytime.
